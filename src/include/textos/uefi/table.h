                                   being passed into update capsule.
  @param[in]   CapsuleCount        Number of pointers to EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER in
                                   CaspuleHeaderArray.
  @param[out]  MaxiumCapsuleSize   On output the maximum size that UpdateCapsule() can
                                   support as an argument to UpdateCapsule() via
                                   CapsuleHeaderArray and ScatterGatherList.
  @param[out]  ResetType           Returns the type of reset required for the capsule update.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           Valid answer returned.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The capsule type is not supported on this platform, and
                                MaximumCapsuleSize and ResetType are undefined.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER MaximumCapsuleSize is NULL.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  When ExitBootServices() has been previously called this error indicates the capsule 
                                is compatible with this platform but is not capable of being submitted or processed 
                                in runtime. The caller may resubmit the capsule prior to ExitBootServices().
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  When ExitBootServices() has not been previously called then this error indicates 
                                the capsule is compatible with this platform but there are insufficient resources to process.
